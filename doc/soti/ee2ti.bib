In this letter, we show that this belief is false in general. Most significantly, we show that the entanglement Hamiltonian can undergo quantum phase transitions in which its ground state and low energy spectrum exhibit singular changes, even when the physical system remains in the same phase. For broken symmetry problems, this implies that the ES and the Renyi entropies can mislead entirely, while for quantum Hall systems the ES has much less universal content than assumed to date.},

Consistent with previous work on entanglement spectra of topological band structures, we find that the entanglement levels exhibit a spectral flow similar to that of the full system's energy spectrum. While the energy spectra are continuous, with cylindrical boundary conditions the entanglement spectra exhibit discontinuities associated with the passage of an energy edge state through the Fermi level. We show how the entanglement spectrum can be understood by examining the band projectors of the full system and their behavior under adiabatic pumping. In so doing we make connections with the original work by Thouless, Kohmoto, Nightingale, and den Nijs (TKNN) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 49, 405 (1982)] on topological two-dimensional band structures and their Chern numbers. Finally, we consider Wannier states and their adiabatic flows and draw connections to the entanglement properties.},

Particularly intriguing are critical spin liquids, where strongly interacting excitations control low energy properties. Here we calculate their bipartite entanglement entropy that characterizes their quantum structure. In particular we calculate the Renyi entropy S2 on model wave functions obtained by Gutzwiller projection of a Fermi sea. Although the wave functions are not sign positive, S2 can be calculated on relatively large systems ($>$324 spins) using the variational Monte Carlo technique. On the triangular lattice we find that entanglement entropy of the projected Fermi sea state violates the boundary law, with S2 enhanced by a logarithmic factor. This is an unusual result for a bosonic wave function reflecting the presence of emergent fermions. These techniques can be extended to study a wide class of other phases.},

A universal characterization of gapped topological phases is provided by the topological entanglement entropy (TEE). We study the finite size corrections to the TEE by focusing on systems with a Z2 topological ordered state using density-matrix renormalization group and perturbative series expansions. We find that extrapolations of the TEE based on the Renyi entropies with a Renyi index of n$\geq$2 suffer from much larger finite size corrections than do extrapolations based on the von Neumann entropy. In particular, when the circumference of the cylinder is about ten times the correlation length, the TEE obtained using von Neumann entropy has an error of order 10-3, while for Renyi entropies it can even exceed 40\%. We discuss the relevance of these findings to previous and future searches for topological ordered phases, including quantum spin liquids.},

In this paper, we try to establish a connection between the lower bound of the von Neumann entropy and the Berry phase defined for quantum ground states. As an example, a family of translational invariant lattice free fermion systems with two bands separated by a finite gap is investigated. We argue that, for one-dimensional (1D) cases, when the Berry phase (Zak's phase) of the occupied band is equal to $\pi$\texttimes{}(oddinteger) and when the ground state respects a discrete unitary particle-hole symmetry (chiral symmetry), the entanglement entropy in the thermodynamic limit is at least larger than ln 2 (per boundary), i.e., the entanglement entropy that corresponds to a maximally entangled pair of two qubits. We also discuss how this lower bound is related to vanishing of the expectation value of a certain nonlocal operator which creates a kink in 1D systems.},

Our work, based on an alternative model on the breathing Kagome lattice, revealed that the different types of corners in the lattice could actually be conditionally gapless, or always gapped. Using the Wilson loop formalism, we argue that these corner states occur when the eigenvalues of the Wannier Hamiltonian cross through a certain reference point during the conceptual "pumping" procedure. The results demonstrate the corner of the Kagome lattice based HOTI is a zero-dimensional analogue of the 1D chiral edge states on the boundary of a Chern insulator, but with a sensitive dependence on the shape of the corner. Our method of the pumping cylinder, which reveals the symmetry/gapless-ability correspondence, can be generalized into a general scheme in determining the classification of corner(hinge) states in HOTI.},

By tracing out part of the degrees of freedom of correlated quantum systems, useful and non-trivial information can be obtained through the study of the reduced density matrix, whose eigenvalue spectrum (the entanglement spectrum) and the associated R\'enyi entropies are now well recognized to contain key features. In particular, the celebrated area law for the entanglement entropy of ground-states will be discussed from the perspective of its subleading corrections which encode universal details of various quantum states of matter, e.g. symmetry breaking states or topological order. Going beyond entropies, the study of the low-lying part of the entanglement spectrum also allows to diagnose topological properties or give a direct access to the excitation spectrum of the edges, and may also raise significant questions about the underlying entanglement Hamiltonian. All these powerful tools can be further applied to shed some light on disordered quantum systems where impurity/disorder can conspire with quantum fluctuations to induce non-trivial effects. Disordered quantum spin systems, the Kondo effect, or the many-body localization problem, which have all been successfully (re)visited through the prism of quantum entanglement, will be discussed in detail. Finally, the issue of experimental access to entanglement measurement will be addressed, together with its most recent developments.},

In particular, we show that degeneracies of the entanglement spectrum correspond to gapless edge modes.},

  abstract = {We study the ``entanglement spectrum'' (a presentation of the Schmidt decomposition analogous to a set of ``energy levels'') of a many-body state, and compare the Moore-Read model wave function for the $\nu$=5/2 fractional quantum Hall state with a generic 5/2 state obtained by finite-size diagonalization of the second-Landau-level-projected Coulomb interactions. Their spectra share a common ``gapless'' structure, related to conformal field theory. In the model state, these are the only levels, while in the ``generic'' case, they are separated from the rest of the spectrum by a clear ``entanglement gap'', which appears to remain finite in the thermodynamic limit. We propose that the low-lying entanglement spectrum can be used as a ``fingerprint'' to identify topological order.},

  abstract = {We devise a generic recipe for constructing D-dimensional lattice models whose d-dimensional boundary states, located on surfaces, hinges, corners, and so forth, can be obtained exactly. The solvability is rooted in the underlying lattice structure and as such does not depend on fine tuning, allowing us to track their evolution throughout various phases and across phase transitions. Most saliently, our models provide ``boundary solvable'' examples of the recently introduced higher-order topological phases. We apply our general approach to breathing and anisotropic kagome and pyrochlore lattices for which we obtain exact corner eigenstates, and to periodically driven two-dimensional models as well as to three-dimensional lattices where we present exact solutions corresponding to one-dimensional chiral states at the hinges of the lattice. We relate the higher-order topological nature of these models to reflection symmetries in combination with their provenance from lower-dimensional conventional topological phases.},

  title = {Higher-{{Order Topology}} in {{Bismuth}}},
  abstract = {The mathematical field of topology has become a framework to describe the low-energy electronic structure of crystalline solids. A typical feature of a bulk insulating three-dimensional topological crystal are conducting two-dimensional surface states. This constitutes the topological bulk-boundary correspondence. Here, we establish that the electronic structure of bismuth, an element consistently described as bulk topologically trivial, is in fact topological and follows a generalized bulk-boundary correspondence of higher-order: not the surfaces of the crystal, but its hinges host topologically protected conducting modes. These hinge modes are protected against localization by time-reversal symmetry locally, and globally by the three-fold rotational symmetry and inversion symmetry of the bismuth crystal. We support our claim theoretically and experimentally. Our theoretical analysis is based on symmetry arguments, topological indices, first-principle calculations, and the recently introduced framework of topological quantum chemistry. We provide supporting evidence from two complementary experimental techniques. With scanning-tunneling spectroscopy, we probe the unique signatures of the rotational symmetry of the one-dimensional states located at step edges of the crystal surface. With Josephson interferometry, we demonstrate their universal topological contribution to the electronic transport. Our work establishes bismuth as a higher-order topological insulator.},

  abstract = {Three-dimensional topological (crystalline) insulators are materials with an insulating bulk but conducting surface states that are topologically protected by time-reversal (or spatial) symmetries. We extend the notion of three-dimensional topological insulators to systems that host no gapless surface states but exhibit topologically protected gapless hinge states. Their topological character is protected by spatiotemporal symmetries of which we present two cases: (i) Chiral higher-order topological insulators protected by the combination of time-reversal and a fourfold rotation symmetry. Their hinge states are chiral modes, and the bulk topology is $<$img class="highwire-embed" alt="Embedded Image" src="http://advances.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/highwire/advances/4/6/eaat0346/embed/mml-math-1.gif"/$>$-classified. (ii) Helical higher-order topological insulators protected by time-reversal and mirror symmetries. Their hinge states come in Kramers pairs, and the bulk topology is Z-classified. We provide the topological invariants for both cases. Furthermore, we show that SnTe as well as surface-modified Bi2TeI, BiSe, and BiTe are helical higher-order topological insulators and propose a realistic experimental setup to detect the hinge states.
A new class of materials that are insulating in the bulk and on surfaces but have conducting hinge channels is studied.
