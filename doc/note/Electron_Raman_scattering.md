### Electron Raman scattering

It measures the imaginary part (using optical theorem) of electron bubble with two Raman vertices, which are the 4-point electron-photon vertices $$AAc^\dagger c$$.

For different incoming and scattering optical polarization direction, different Brillouin zone  regimes (with different weight) are measured. They can further be classified into different irrespective representations.

For comparison, the bubble with 3-point electron-photon vertices ($Ac^\dagger c$) measures the photon emission/absorption, which is directly related to optical conductivity.
