# symmetry and degeneracy

- First take time Kramers degeneracy as an example:
  $$
  (k\uparrow) \overset{TR}{\longrightarrow}(-k\downarrow)\overset{I}{\longrightarrow}(k\downarrow)
  $$

- In general, if there is a symmetry (or combined symmetry) to connect different internal components, they degenerate. We say all the connected components construct an irreducible representation of the symmetry group.
