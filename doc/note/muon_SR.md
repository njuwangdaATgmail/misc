### $\mu$SR in Abrikosov vortex lattice


$$
\mu^+ \rightarrow e^+ + \nu_e + \bar{\nu}_\mu
$$

The emitted positron decays with the probability
$$
W(E,\theta)=1+a(E)\cos\theta
$$
The decay positrons are detected, leading to asymmetry spectrum
$$
a_0\int_0^\infty n(B)\cos(\gamma_\mu Bt+\phi)\text{d}B.
$$
where $\gamma_\mu$ is the muon gyromagnetic ratio and $n(B)$ is the magnetic field density which is known for a perfect flux line lattice and approximated as a Gaussian distribution.
