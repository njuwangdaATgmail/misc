  abstract = {Using Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we study a series of models of fermions coupled to quantum Ising spins on a square lattice with \$N\$ flavors of fermions per site for \$N=1,2\$ and \$3\$. The models have an extensive number of conserved quantities but are not integrable, and have rather rich phase diagrams consisting of several exotic phases and phase transitions that lie beyond Landau-Ginzburg paradigm. In particular, one of the prominent phase for \$N$>$1\$ corresponds to \$2N\$ gapless Dirac fermions coupled to an emergent \$$\backslash$mathbb\{Z\}\_2\$ gauge field in its deconfined phase. However, unlike a conventional \$$\backslash$mathbb\{Z\}\_2\$ gauge theory, we do not impose the ‘Gauss's Law' by hand and instead, it emerges due to spontaneous symmetry breaking. Correspondingly, unlike a conventional \$$\backslash$mathbb\{Z\}\_2\$ gauge theory in two spatial dimensions, our models have a finite temperature phase transition associated with the melting of the order parameter that dynamically imposes the Gauss's law constraint at zero temperature. By tuning a parameter, the deconfined phase undergoes a transition into a short range entangled phase, which corresponds to N$\backslash$'eel/Superconductor for \$N=2\$ and a Valence Bond Solid for \$N=3\$. Furthermore, for \$N=3\$, the Valence Bond Solid further undergoes a transition to a N$\backslash$'eel phase consistent with the deconfined quantum critical phenomenon studied earlier in the context of quantum magnets.},

  abstract = {The theory of deconfined quantum critical points describes phase transitions at temperature T = 0 outside the standard paradigm, predicting continuous transformations between certain ordered states where conventional theory requires discontinuities. Numerous computer simulations have offered no proof of such transitions, however, instead finding deviations from expected scaling relations that were neither predicted by the DQC theory nor conform to standard scenarios. Here we show that this enigma can be resolved by introducing a critical scaling form with two divergent length scales. Simulations of a quantum magnet with antiferromagnetic and dimerized ground states confirm the form, proving a continuous transition with deconfined excitations and also explaining anomalous scaling at T $>$ 0. Our findings revise prevailing paradigms for quantum criticality, with potentially far-reaching implications for many strongly-correlated materials.},

Taking advantage of the high measurement precision offered by an ultrastable laser, we report a spectroscopic observation of SU(N $\leq$ 10) symmetry in 87Sr. By encoding the electronic orbital degree of freedom in two clock states while keeping the system open to as many as 10 nuclear spin sublevels, we probed the non-equilibrium two-orbital SU(N) magnetism via Ramsey spectroscopy of atoms confined in an array of two-dimensional optical traps; we studied the spin-orbital quantum dynamics and determined the relevant interaction parameters. This study lays the groundwork for using alkaline-earth atoms as testbeds for important orbital models.
Studying magnetism with cold atoms
Physicists have used cold atomic gases to simulate quantum phenomena that we normally associate with much more complex systems, such as solid-state materials. Because the properties of these gases are so tunable, it is also possible to create conditions that otherwise do not exist in nature. Zhang et al. studied an exotic type of magnetism in an array of pancake-shaped atomic clouds of 87Sr. They prepared the atoms' nuclei in different combinations of 10 quantum states. They then shone pulses of light at the atoms to deduce the properties of the atoms' interactions. The interactions were independent of the atoms' nuclear states\textemdash{}a hallmark of an unusual symmetry that theorists predict may lead to interesting collective effects.

  abstract = {We examine large-N limits of the nearest-neighbor SU(N) quantum antiferromagnets on bipartite lattices in d=1,2. In d=2 the model displays a transition from a N\'eel to a disordered phase. The properties of the disordered phase close to the phase boundary are crucially dependent upon the nature of ``hedgehog''-like instanton tunneling events. We calculate the Berry phases of the instantons and show that, at scales larger than the spin-correlation length, the system can be described by a Coulomb plasma of instantons with complex fugacities. The properties of the Coulomb plasma vary periodically with the ``spin'' nc of the states at each site, with periodicity given by the coordination number Z of the lattice [nc=2S for SU(2)]. For nc$\not =$0 (mod Z) the disordered phase has a broken lattice symmetry with spin-Peierls order, while for nc=0 (mod Z), the ground state is a valence-bond solid state with no broken symmetry. Related topological effects for the d=1 chain lead to spin-Peierls order for odd nc. These results are for a class of models which have, at sites of the A sublattice, representations of SU(N) described by a Young tableau with a single row, and the conjugate on the B sublattice. Similar results are also obtained for representations with m rows, using U(m) gauge theory.},

The Q3 term consists of three bond-singlet projectors and is chosen to favor the formation of a valence-bond solid (VBS) where the valence bonds (singlet pairs) form a staggered pattern. The model exhibits a quantum phase transition from the N\'eel state to the VBS as a function of Q3/J. We study the model using quantum Monte Carlo (stochastic series expansion) simulations. The N\'eel-VBS transition in this case is strongly first order in nature, in contrast to similar previously studied models with continuous transitions into columnar VBS states. The qualitatively different transitions illustrate the important role of an emerging U(1) symmetry in the latter case, which is not possible in the present model due to the staggered VBS pattern (which does not allow local fluctuations necessary to rotate the local VBS order parameter).},

  abstract = {The ground-state parameters of the two-dimensional S=1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model are calculated using the stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo method for L\texttimes{}L lattices with L up to 16. The finite-size results for the energy E, the sublattice magnetization M, the long-wavelength susceptibility $\chi\perp$(q=2$\pi$/L), and the spin stiffness $\rho$s, are extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit using fits to polynomials in 1/L, constrained by scaling forms previously obtained from renormalization-group calculations for the nonlinear $\sigma$ model and chiral perturbation theory. The results are fully consistent with the predicted leading finite-size corrections, and are of sufficient accuracy for extracting also subleading terms. The subleading energy correction ($\sim$1/L4) agrees with chiral perturbation theory to within a statistical error of a few percent, thus providing numerical confirmation of the finite-size scaling forms to this order. The extrapolated ground- state energy per spin is E=-0.669437(5). The result from previous Green's function Monte Carlo (GFMC) calculations is slightly higher than this value, most likely due to a small systematic error originating from ``population control'' bias in GFMC. The other extrapolated parameters are M=0.3070(3), $\rho$s=0.175(2), $\chi\perp$=0.0625(9), and the spin-wave velocity c=1.673(7). The statistical errors are comparable with those of previous estimates obtained by fitting loop algorithm quantum Monte Carlo data to finite-temperature scaling forms. Both M and $\rho$s obtained from the finite-T data are, however, a few error bars higher than the present estimates. It is argued that the T=0 extrapolations performed here are less sensitive to effects of neglected higher-order corrections, and therefore should be more reliable.},

A generic SO(5) or isomorphically, Sp(4) symmetry is proved in such systems with the s-wave scattering interactions in optical traps, or with the on-site Hubbard interactions in optical lattices. Various important features from this high symmetry are studied in the Fermi liquid theory, the mean field phase diagram, and the sign problem in quantum Monte-Carlo simulations. In the s-wave quintet Cooper pairing phase, the half-quantum vortex exhibits the global analogue of the Alice string and non-Abelian Cheshire charge properties in gauge theories. The existence of the quartetting phase, a four-fermion counterpart of the Cooper pairing phase, and its competition with other orders are studied in one-dimensional spin-3/2 systems. We also show that counter-intuitively quantum fluctuations in spin-3/2 magnetic systems are even stronger than those in spin-1/2 systems.},

  abstract = {Numerical studies of the transition between N\'eel and valence bond solid phases in two-dimensional quantum antiferromagnets give strong evidence for the remarkable scenario of deconfined criticality, but display strong violations of finite-size scaling that are not yet understood. We show how to realize the universal physics of the N\'eel\textendash{}valence-bond-solid (VBS) transition in a three-dimensional classical loop model (this model includes the subtle interference effect that suppresses hedgehog defects in the N\'eel order parameter). We use the loop model for simulations of unprecedentedly large systems (up to linear size L=512). Our results are compatible with a continuous transition at which both N\'eel and VBS order parameters are critical, and we do not see conventional signs of first-order behavior. However, we show that the scaling violations are stronger than previously realized and are incompatible with conventional finite-size scaling, even if allowance is made for a weakly or marginally irrelevant scaling variable. In particular, different approaches to determining the anomalous dimensions $\eta$VBS and $\eta$N\'eel yield very different results. The assumption of conventional finite-size scaling leads to estimates that drift to negative values at large sizes, in violation of the unitarity bounds. In contrast, the decay with distance of critical correlators on scales much smaller than system size is consistent with large positive anomalous dimensions. Barring an unexpected reversal in behavior at still larger sizes, this implies that the transition, if continuous, must show unconventional finite-size scaling, for example, from an additional dangerously irrelevant scaling variable. Another possibility is an anomalously weak first-order transition. By analyzing the renormalization group flows for the noncompact CPn-1 field theory (the n-component Abelian Higgs model) between two and four dimensions, we give the simplest scenario by which an anomalously weak first-order transition can arise without fine-tuning of the Hamiltonian.},

  abstract = {We present the critical theory of a number of zero-temperature phase transitions of quantum antiferromagnets and interacting boson systems in two dimensions. The most important example is the transition of the S=1$\slash$2 square lattice antiferromagnet between the N\'eel state (which breaks spin rotation invariance) and the paramagnetic valence bond solid (which preserves spin rotation invariance but breaks lattice symmetries). We show that these two states are separated by a second-order quantum phase transition. This conflicts with Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson theory, which predicts that such states with distinct broken symmetries are generically separated either by a first-order transition, or by a phase with co-existing orders. The critical theory of the second-order transition is not expressed in terms of the order parameters characterizing either state, but involves fractionalized degrees of freedom and an emergent, topological, global conservation law. A closely related theory describes the superfluid-insulator transition of bosons at half filling on a square lattice, in which the insulator has a bond density wave order. Similar considerations are shown to apply to transitions of antiferromagnets between the valence bond solid and the Z2 spin liquid: the critical theory has deconfined excitations interacting with an emergent U(1) gauge force. We comment on the broader implications of our results for the study of quantum criticality in correlated electron systems.},

We investigate the competing orders in the half-filled SU(2N) Hubbard model on a honeycomb lattice, which can be accurately realized in optical lattices with ultracold large-spin alkaline-earth fermions. Employing large-scale projector determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we have explored quantum phase transitions from the gapless Dirac semimetals to the gapped Mott insulating phases in the SU(4) and SU(6) cases. Both of these Mott insulating states are found to be columnar valence bond solid (cVBS) and to be absent of the antiferromagnetic N\'eel ordering and the loop current ordering. Inside the cVBS phases, the dimer ordering is enhanced by increasing fermion components and behaves nonmonotonically as the interaction strength increases. Although the transitions generally should be of first order due to a cubic invariance possessed by the cVBS order, the coupling to gapless Dirac fermions can soften the transitions to second order through a nonanalytic term in the free energy. Our simulations provide important guidance for the experimental explorations of novel states of matter with ultracold alkaline-earth fermions.},

  abstract = {We present an extensive quantum Monte Carlo study of the N\'eel to valence-bond solid (VBS) phase transition on rectangular- and honeycomb-lattice SU(N) antiferromagnets in sign-problem-free models. We find that in contrast to the honeycomb lattice and previously studied square-lattice systems, on the rectangular lattice for small N, a first-order N\'eel-VBS transition is realized. On increasing N$\geq$4, we observe that the transition becomes continuous and with the same universal exponents as found on the honeycomb and square lattices (studied here for N=5, 7, 10), providing strong support for a deconfined quantum critical point. Combining our new results with previous numerical and analytical studies, we present a general phase diagram of the stability of CPN-1 fixed points with q monopoles.},

These theories share important features with (3+1)-d QCD, such as asymptotic freedom and \texttheta{}-vacua. Moreover, their continuum limit can be accessed via the mechanism of dimensional reduction. In our scheme, the CP(N-1) ~degrees of freedom emerge at low energies from a ladder system of SU(N) quantum spins, where the N spin states are embodied by the nuclear Zeeman states of alkaline-earth atoms, trapped in an optical lattice. Based on Monte Carlo results, we establish that the continuum limit can be demonstrated by an atomic quantum simulation by employing the feature of asymptotic freedom. We discuss a protocol for the adiabatic preparation of the ground state of the system, the real-time evolution of a false \texttheta{}-vacuum state after a quench, and we propose experiments to unravel the phase diagram at non-zero density.},

On the theory side, we survey the zoo of phases that have been predicted for both gases in a trap and loaded into an optical lattice, focusing on two and three dimensional systems. We also discuss some of the challenges that lie ahead for the realization of such phases such as reaching the temperature scale required to observe magnetic and more exotic quantum orders. The challenge of dealing with collisional relaxation of excited electronic levels is also discussed.},

  abstract = {The Hartree-Fock equations state that each electron in an atom or molecular system should move in a different potential. In some cases, particularly magnetic cases, this leads to important consequences, since electrons with opposite spins move in different potentials. In particular, in an antiferromagnetic substance, electrons of + and - spin have different potentials; and for an electron of + spin, for instance, the potential energy is lower in those atoms whose spins are pointed in the + direction than in those with the opposite spin. This results in a periodic perturbation of potential, with periodicity twice the atomic periodicity, and leads to a splitting of each energy band in half, with a gap in the middle. In a case where the energy band was half full, resulting in a conductor: when we disregard this effect, the resulting half-band will be just filled when we consider it; this may explain the insulating nature of some antiferromagnetics. A similar argument applied to a diatomic molecule like H2 can result in two alternative types of solutions of the Hartree-Fock equations: one leading to atomic orbitals, the other to molecular orbitals. The solution with atomic orbitals shows an analogy to the antiferromagnetic problem; that with ordinary molecular orbitals shows an analogy to the band theory of a non-magnetic conductor.},

The properties of the metals nickel, palladium and platinum are discussed in the light of these results; platinum differs from nickel in that the orbital contribution to the moment of the elementary magnets is not quenched.

  abstract = {Motivated by the numerical evidence of a continuous phase transition between antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases in the half-filled SU(N) Hubbbard model, we studied its low energy nonlinear sigma model defined on Grassman manifold \$U(N)/U(m)U(N-m)\$ using the complex projective presentation, which is a direct generalization of the widely studied CP\$\^\{N-1\}\$ model (corresponding to \$m=1\$). With the \$1/N\$ expansion technique up to the first order by fixing \$m\$ in space dimension \$2$<$d$<$4\$, we calculate the critical exponents of the Neel moment, which are found to be only functions of \$m/N\$. Our results indicate that larger \$m\$ effectively reduces \$N\$ and thus brings stronger fluctuations around the saddle point at \$N=$\backslash$infty\$.},

  title = {Metal-Insulator Transitions},
  volume = {70},
  doi = {10.1103/RevModPhys.70.1039},
  abstract = {Metal-insulator transitions are accompanied by huge resistivity changes, even over tens of orders of magnitude, and are widely observed in condensed-matter systems. This article presents the observations and current understanding of the metal-insulator transition with a pedagogical introduction to the subject. Especially important are the transitions driven by correlation effects associated with the electron-electron interaction. The insulating phase caused by the correlation effects is categorized as the Mott Insulator. Near the transition point the metallic state shows fluctuations and orderings in the spin, charge, and orbital degrees of freedom. The properties of these metals are frequently quite different from those of ordinary metals, as measured by transport, optical, and magnetic probes. The review first describes theoretical approaches to the unusual metallic states and to the metal-insulator transition. The Fermi-liquid theory treats the correlations that can be adiabatically connected with the noninteracting picture. Strong-coupling models that do not require Fermi-liquid behavior have also been developed. Much work has also been done on the scaling theory of the transition. A central issue for this review is the evaluation of these approaches in simple theoretical systems such as the Hubbard model and t-J models. Another key issue is strong competition among various orderings as in the interplay of spin and orbital fluctuations. Experimentally, the unusual properties of the metallic state near the insulating transition have been most extensively studied in d-electron systems. In particular, there is revived interest in transition-metal oxides, motivated by the epoch-making findings of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates and colossal magnetoresistance in manganites. The article reviews the rich phenomena of anomalous metallicity, taking as examples Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Ru compounds. The diverse phenomena include strong spin and orbital fluctuations, mass renormalization effects, incoherence of charge dynamics, and phase transitions under control of key parameters such as band filling, bandwidth, and dimensionality. These parameters are experimentally varied by doping, pressure, chemical composition, and magnetic fields. Much of the observed behavior can be described by the current theory. Open questions and future problems are also extracted from comparison between experimental results and theoretical achievements.},
