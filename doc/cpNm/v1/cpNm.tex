\begin{abstract}
    Motivated by the realization of SU(N) antiferromagnetism with the multi-row representations in cold atom physics, we studied its low energy nonlinear sigma model defined on Grassman manifold
  $U(N)/U(m)U(N-m)$ using the complex projective presentation, which is a direct generalization of the widely studied
  CP$^{N-1}$ model (corresponding to $m=1$). With the $1/N$ expansion technique up to the first order by fixing $m$ in space dimension
  $2<d<4$, we calculate the critical exponents including two particle ones which are gauge independent and measurable in experiments directly. These exponents are found to depend only on $m/N$, indicating that larger $m$ effectively reduces $N$ and thus causes stronger fluctuations around the saddle point at $N=\infty$.

\section{Introduction}
% SU(N)-spin symmetry breaking: dependence of m physical realization: cold atom fermionic system and QMC results
% universality class, CP model
Spin is a fundamental property of elementary particles inherited from the spatial SO(3) symmetry. For a single electron,
there are only three independent spin directions corresponding to three generators of the SO(3) or its isomorphic SU(2) group. In solids, different
electrons can be combined by Hund's coupling to form larger spins as different representations of the SU(2)
group. If all other degrees of freedom such as charge are frozen, the system is said to be described by an effective
spin model, \eg the famous Heisenberg model. Due to the lacking of small parameters, the spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg model is
difficult to solve perturbatively. In such a background, people introduced the SU(N) spin such that $1/N$ can
be taken as a perturbation parameter.
\cite{affleck1985,affleck1988,*marston1989,arovas1988,read1989,*read1989a,*read1990} One important consequence of the
larger SU(N) group is that it has more ($N^2-1$) independent spin directions (generators), which can be broken into
different kinds of magnetic ordered states. Taking antiferromagnetic (AF) order as an example, the spin in A-sublattice
is represented by a Young tableau with $m$ rows and $n_c$ columns, while the spin in B-sublattice belongs to its
conjugate representation, \ie $N-m$ rows and $n_c$ columns. In recent years, the SU(N) Heisenberg model and its
variations have been extensively studied mainly focusing on the case of $m=1$ (called fundamental representation) from
different theoretical approaches.
\cite{harada2003,buchta2007,kawashima2007,arovas2008,beach2009,lou2009,rachel2009,kaul2012,harada2013,nataf2014,okubo2015,suzuki2015,nataf2016}

On the other hand, the fast development of cold atom physics provides an natural realization of the SU(N)
spin since the carriers in an optical lattice are not electrons but atoms possessing larger hyperfine spins.
\cite{wu2003,wu2005,*wu2006,honerkamp2004,taie2010,desalvo2010,krauser2012,zhang2014,hart2015} 
Such a fermionic system is effectively described by the SU(N) Hubbard model.
\cite{honerkamp2004,assaad2005,cai2013a,cai2013,wang2014,zhou2014,*zhou2016,*zhou2017} On the square lattice with
particle hole symmetry, AF order with $m=N/2$ (called self conjugate representation) are found to be suppressed by
either large $N$ or large $U$ (Hubbard interaction) and even driven to valence bond solid (VBS) state.
\cite{cai2013,wang2014} In special, very recently, by a high precision QMC calculation on the SU(6) Hubbard model, one of the authors
and his collaborators have found evidence that the AF phase transition is continuous with its critical exponents obtained.  
\cite{wang2014,wang2018}
These studies naturally post an interesting theoretical question on how to describe such novel critical points beyond the case of $m=1$ which is effectively described by a multi-component generalization of the Ginzburg-Landau theory called CP$^{N-1}$ model.
\cite{halperin1974,hikami1979,read1989,read1989a,chubukov1994,starykh1994,irkhin1996,kaul2008,block2013,demidio2017} However, the
general case with $m>1$ has received very little attention. \cite{macfarlane1979,hikami1980,duerksen1981,maharana1983}
To the best of our knowledge, particularly, the theoretical calculations of critical exponents of either AF or
VBS order parameters are still missing. In this work, we focus on the AF phase transition with general $m$. We first derive a generalized
CP$^{N-1}$ model from the nonlinear sigma model on the Grassmann manifold $U(N)/U(m)U(N-m)$, and then perform a tentative study using $1/N$ expansion
technique to calculate the critical exponents. Up to the first order, our results of these critical exponents
depend only on $m/N$ indicating that larger $m$ effectively reduces $N$ and thus causes stronger fluctuations around the saddle point solutions
in the large $N$ limit. 


\section{Model}
As a physical realization, we start from the fermionic representation (\eg in the SU(N) Hubbard model) of the SU(N) AF order parameter \bea
\mathcal{N}_i^b=(-1)^i\langle \Psi_i^\dagger \sigma_b \Psi_i\rangle \eea where $\Psi_i$ is an N-flavor fermion field and
$\sigma_b$ ($1\le b\le N^2-1$) denote the SU(N) group generators satisfying a normalization condition
$\mathrm{tr}(\sigma_b^2)=N$ within this work. In the normal (paramagnetic) state all these $(N^2-1)$ branches of magnetic modes
degenerate as a result of the SU(N) symmetry. While in the AF state, the SU(N) symmetry can be broken into different
irreducible representations which are characterized by an additional parameter $m$: there are $m$ and $(N-m)$ fermions on two sublattices, respectively. For simplicity but without loss of generality, we can always use a diagonal matrix \bea
\sigma_m=\text{diag}\left[P_+,\cdots,P_+,-P_,\cdots,-P_-\right] \eea to represent the ordered moment where
$P_+=P_-^{-1}=\sqrt{(N-m)/m}$, and thus the AF order parameter is simply given by \bea
\mathcal{N}_i^m=(-1)^i\left[P_+\sum_{\alpha=1}^m n_{i\alpha}-P_-\sum_{\alpha=m+1}^{N}n_{i\alpha} \right]. \eea where
$n_{i\alpha}$ is the fermion occupation number. 

Near the AF phase transition, if fermionic excitations are gapped out by interactions, the critical behavior is governed by the nonlinear sigma model \bea
\label{eq:NLsM}S=\frac{\rho_s}{2}\int \partial_\mu\bn \cdot \partial_\mu\bn \eea where $\rho_s$ is the spin stiffness,
$\mu$ denotes the space indices, $\int$ means spatial integral and $\bn$ is the normalized AF moment $\mathcal{N}$.
The action $S$ is directly related to the partition function $Z=\int \me^{-S}$. In this work, we parametrize $\bn$ using
the complex representation \bea \label{eq:cprep}n_b=\sum_{i=1}^m z_i^\dag \sigma_b z_i=\mathrm{Tr}(Z^\dag\sigma_b Z)
\eea where $z_i$ is an N-flavor boson field (spinon) and $m$ copies of $z_i$ are put together to form a complex
$N\times m$ matrix $Z$. Next, applying the Fierz identity of the $SU(N)$ group \bea \label{eq:Fierz}
(\sigma_b)_{\alpha\beta}
(\sigma_b)_{\gamma\delta}+\delta_{\alpha\beta}\delta_{\gamma\delta}=N\delta_{\alpha\delta}\delta_{\beta\gamma} \eea we
get \bea \bn\cdot\bn = N\mathrm{Tr}(ZZ^\dag Z Z^\dag)-[\mathrm{Tr}(ZZ^\dag)]^2 \eea In order to maintain $\bn\cdot\bn=1$,
we impose a constraint condition \bea Z^\dag Z=\frac{1}{\sqrt{m(N-m)}}I \label{eq:normalizeZ}\eea where $I$ is a
rank-$m$ unit matrix. This constraint equation indicates that the spinon field lives on the Grassmann manifold
$U(N)/U(m)U(N-m)$. 

Substituting the complex representation Eq.~\ref{eq:cprep} into Eq.~\ref{eq:NLsM} and again applying the Fierz identity
, we obtain \bea S &=& N\rho_s \int\mathrm{Tr}\left[-(i\partial_\mu Z^\dagger Z) (-iZ^\dag \partial_\mu
Z) \right. \nonumber\\  &+& \left. Z^\dag Z (i\partial_\mu Z^\dagger)(-i\partial_\mu Z)\right] .\eea The first term can
be further decoupled by introducing an auxiliary Hubbard-Stratonovich field $\bA$, leading to \bea \label{eq:cpNm0} S=\frac{N\rho_s}{\sqrt{m(N-m)}}\int
\mathrm{Tr}\left[ (i\partial_\mu Z^\dag+A_\mu Z^\dag)(-i\partial_\mu Z+ZA_\mu)  \right] \nonumber\\ \eea 
Here $A_\mu$ is an $m\times m$ matrix and the vector $\bA$ is a non-Abelian gauge field. The action is invariant under a global $U(N)$ and a local $U(m)$ transformations: $Z\rightarrow U_NZU_m$ and $A_\mu\rightarrow U_m^\dag A_\mu U_m-iU^\dag\partial_\mu U$. \cite{macfarlane1979,duerksen1981}
The $Z$ field can be further rescaled to eliminate the prefactor
$N\rho_s/\sqrt{m(N-m)}$, which after the rescaling appears in the right hand side of the constraint condition Eq.~\ref{eq:normalizeZ}. Using the
rescaled field and introducing a real Lagrangian multiplier matrix $\lambda$ to incorporate the constraint condition, we
arrive at \bea \label{eq:cpNm} S&=&\int \mathrm{Tr}\left[ (i\partial_\mu Z^\dag+A_\mu Z^\dag)(-i\partial_\mu Z+ZA_\mu)
\right] \nonumber \\ &+& i\int \mathrm{Tr}\left\{\lambda\left[Z^\dag Z-\frac{N\rho_s}{m(N-m)}I\right]\right\} .
\eea 
This model has the same form of the famous CP$^{N-1}$ model (as a special case with $m=1$) except that all $Z$, $A$, $\lambda$ fields now become matrices (or with multi-components). 
In history, such a model was first proposed forty
years ago by MacFarlane \cite{macfarlane1979} and latter studied by some other researchers for different purposes
\cite{hikami1980,duerksen1981,maharana1983}. However, due to the missing of a real physical system governed by such a
model, it received less and less attentions. In this work, we rediscover and apply it to the SU(N) AF system to study
the critical behaviors. To this end, we will only consider the renormalized classical region (keeping only zero frequency in Matsubara summations by neglecting quantum fluctuations) since it is sufficient to obtain the critical exponents for a thermodynamic phase transition. \cite{chubukov1994,starykh1994,irkhin1996}

\section{Large-N limit}
We first study the saddle point solution of $N=\infty$ which becomes exact as a result of the global
prefactor $N$ after tracing out the $Z$-field. The saddle point condition $\delta S/\delta A_\mu$ gives $A_\mu=0$ which
means there is no gauge fluctuation. While the other saddle point condition $\delta S/\delta \lambda=0$ just gives the
constraint condition. In order to describe the ordered phase, we assume \bea Z_{\alpha i}=z_0\delta_{\alpha i}+z_{\alpha
i}. \eea where $\alpha\le N$ and $i\le m$. The first term represents the condensation when $z_0\ne0$ with a remaining
$U(m)$ symmetry and the second term describes spinon fluctuations. Now the constraint condition becomes
\bea \label{eq:Ninfty} z_0^2 + NT\int_k \frac{1}{k^2} = \frac{N\rho_s}{{m(N-m)}}. \eea 

We first examine the critical exponents of the $Z$ field. At $T=T_c$, $z_0=0$ and $G_z(k)=k^{-2}$ which gives $\eta_z=0$
by definition $G_z(k)\sim k^{\eta-2}$. The exponent $\gamma_z$ is related to the uniform static susceptibility, or
equivalently $G_z(k=0)$ above $T_c$. In this case, a mass term $\Delta$ should be added to retain the constraint
condition, \ie $G_z(k)=(k^2+\Delta)^{-1}$. \cite{ma1973} Then from Eq.~\ref{eq:Ninfty}, we get $\Delta\propto t^{2/(d-2)}$ where
$t=(T-T_c)/T_c$. Comparing with the definition $G_z(k=0)\sim t^{-\gamma_z}$, we obtain $\gamma_z=2/(d-2)$. From $\eta_z$
and $\gamma_z$, all other exponents of the $Z$ fields can be obtained from scaling relations. In particular,
$\nu_z=1/(d-2)$ should be the same for all fields since there is only one correlation length, hence we can safely drop its subscript $z$, \ie
$\nu=1/(d-2)$. 

Next, let us focus on the AF moment as a particle-hole pair of the $Z$ field. The order parameter $M$ is
determined by the condensed $Z$ field by definition, \ie $M=mP_+z_0^2$. From Eq.~\ref{eq:Ninfty}, we obtain
$z_0^2\propto t$ and thus $M\propto t$. As a result, the exponent $\beta_n=1$ by definition $M\propto |t|^{\beta_n}$.
Then, in together with $\nu=1/(d-2)$ obtained from above, all remaining exponents in the magnetic channel are readily obtained, 
\eg $\eta_n=d-2$ and $\gamma_n=(4-d)/(d-2)$. 


\section{1/N expansion}
In the large $N$ limit, $m$ plays no role in critical exponents. 
Next, let us go
beyond the saddle point approximation by performing $1/N$ expansion calculation while fixing $m$. Our strategy mainly follows the work by
Irkhin \etal \cite{irkhin1996} which only considered the case with $m=1$. Up to the first order of $1/N$, both
$i\lambda$ and $A$ fields get dynamics from their vacuum polarization processes as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:self}(a) and (b),
\bea \Pi_{ij}^\lambda(q)&=&2z_0^2\frac{1}{q^2} + NT\int_k \frac{1}{k^2(k+q)^2} \nonumber\\
                        &=&\frac{2z_0^2}{q^2}+\frac{TNK_dA_d}{q^{4-d}} \equiv \Pi_\lambda(q) \eea and \bea
\Pi_{ij}^{\mu\nu}(q) &=& 2z_0^2 \frac{q_\mu q_\nu}{q^2} + NT\int_k \frac{(2k_\mu+q_\mu)(2k_\nu+q_\nu)}{k^2(k+q)^2}
\nonumber\\ && - 2z_0^2 \delta_{\mu\nu} -2NT\int_k \frac{1}{k^2}\delta_{\mu\nu}  \nonumber\\
            &=&\left(2z_0^2+\frac{TNK_dA_d}{d-1} q^{d-2}\right)\left(\frac{q_\mu q_\nu}{q^2}-\delta_{\mu\nu}\right)
\nonumber\\ &\equiv& \Pi_A(q)\left(\frac{q_\mu q_\nu}{q^2}-\delta_{\mu\nu}\right) \eea where \bea
K_d^{-1}=2^{d-1}\pi^{d/2}\Gamma\left(\frac{d}{2}\right) \eea and \bea
A_d=\frac{\Gamma(d-2)\Gamma(2-d/2)\Gamma^2(d/2-1)}{2\Gamma(d-2)} \eea 
One good property is that both
$\Pi_{ij}^\lambda(q)$ and $\Pi_{ij}^{\mu\nu}(q)$ do not depend on their subscript $ij$ and $m$, which will greatly
simplify the following calculations. From the vacuum polarizations, we get their propagators
$D_\lambda(q)=-\Pi_\lambda^{-1}$ and $D_A^{\mu\nu}(q)=-\Pi_A^{-1}\left(\frac{q_\mu q_\nu}{q^2}-\delta_{\mu\nu}\right)$
under the Landau gauge. For other gauges, the propagator will explicitly depend on the gauge fixing parameter $\xi$. 
However, since the magnetic moment is gauge independent, the results of its critical exponents should be independent of $\xi$. \cite{kaul2008}
%{\color{red} @WSY: if you like, you can add the gauge fixing parameter $\xi$ explicitly.}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{self.eps}
\caption{\label{fig:self} (a) and (b) show vacuum polarizations of $i\lambda$ and $A$, respectively. (c) shows the self energy of the $z$ field. Solid (double) lines represent propagators of the uncondensed (condensed) $Z$ field. Dashed/wavy lines represent bare $i\lambda$/$A$ fields and their double lines represent dressed propagators caused by the vacuum polarizations in (a) and (b).}
\end{figure}

The self energy of the $Z$ field shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:self}(c) is $\Sigma=\Sigma_\lambda+\Sigma_A$ where \bea
\Sigma_\lambda(k)=-mT\int_q \left[\frac{1}{(k+q)^2}-\frac{1}{q^2}\right]\Pi_\lambda^{-1}(q) \eea and \bea \Sigma_A(k)
&=& mT\int_q \frac{1}{(k+q)^2} D_A^{\mu\nu}(q) (2k_\mu+q_\mu) (2k_\nu+q_\nu) \nonumber \\&=& 4mT\int_q
\frac{1}{(k+q)^2}\Pi_A^{-1}\left[ k^2-\frac{(k\cdot q)^2}{q^2} \right] \eea After completing the bubble integrals, and
extracting the coefficient of the $k^2\ln k$ term, we immediately get $\eta_z=-\frac{(4d-7)m}{NA_d}$, which was first obtained by
Hikami \cite{hikami1980}. However, his calculation was based on single particle propagators and thus can only gave the
critical exponents of the $Z$ field. In this work, we are more interested in the critical exponents of the
physical field $\bn$, as they are gauge independent and accessible in experiments directly. To this end, we have to consider the correlation functions of $\bn$, which is a two-particle
propagator. Keeping only the uniform term ($q=0$) as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:suscept}(b), the susceptibility of $\bn$ is
\bea \chi_0=m^2P_+^2 z_0^4\left[ 1-  2mT\int_k \frac{\Pi_\lambda^{-1}}{k^4} + 4
\left.\frac{\Sigma(k)}{k^2}\right|_{k\rightarrow0} \right] \eea which gives the magnetic moment square $M^2$ as a
function $z_0$. In order to get $\beta_n$, we still need the relation between $z_0$ and $t$, which can be obtained
from the constraint condition as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:suscept}(a), \bea &&z_0^2 \left[ 1-
mT\int_k \frac{\Pi_\lambda^{-1}}{k^4} + 2 \left.\frac{\Sigma(k)}{k^2}\right|_{k\rightarrow0}\right] + NT\int_k
\frac{1}{k^2} \nonumber\\&&+ NT\int_k \frac{\Sigma(k)}{k^4} = \frac{N\rho_s}{m(N-m)}. \eea After some lengthy
but straightforward algebra, we get \bea \beta_n=1-\frac{2m(d^2-d+2)}{NA_d}. \eea Taking together with the
correlation length exponent $\nu=\nu_z$ which had already obtained in Ref.~\cite{hikami1980} \bea
\nu=\frac{1}{d-2}\left[ 1-\frac{2md(d-1)}{NA_d} \right], \eea we get the remaining critical exponents, \bea
\eta_n=(d-2)\left[1-\frac{8m}{NA_d}\right] \eea and \bea \gamma_n=\frac{4-d}{d-2}\left[
1+\frac{8m(d-2)}{(4-d)NA_d}-\frac{2md(d-1)}{NA_d} \right]. \eea 
Although the calculation is somewhat tedious, the
result is quite simple: the critical exponents only depend on $m/N$ rather than $1/N$ as in the
CP$^{N-1}$ model \cite{irkhin1996}. Hence, up to the first order of $1/N$, the critical exponents of $m>1$ are just
equal to those obtained from the CP$^{(N/m)-1}$ model. Such a behavior can be understood by counting the internal spin components: the vacuum polarizations of $i\lambda$ and $A$ as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:self}(a,b) are of order $N$, and thus the self energy as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:self}(c) is of order $m/N$. Since $\eta_z$ is extracted from the self energy directly, its first order correction must be of order $m/N$. The remaining exponents, especially the two particle ones can be analyzed by considering more diagrams as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:suscept}. Finally, we point out that the $m/N$ correction is the property of the first order expansion. Higher orders would lead to other terms like $m/N^2$, $m^2/N^2$, etc. See the discussion section for details.

\end{figure}

\section{Discussion}
In summary, we have derived a generalized CP$^{N-1}$ model on Grassman manifold $U(N)/U(m)U(N-m)$ and performed a $1/N$
expansion calculation of the critical exponents for $2<d<4$, especially the ones of the AF moments which are gauge independent and can be measured in experiments directly. Our theoretical predictions can be checked in cold atom experiments by loading $m$ atoms with hyperfine spin $(N-1)/2$ in A-site and $(N-m)$ atoms in B-site to achieve such an AF critical point.

Finally, some remarks are given:
(1) Our $1/N$ expansion results can not be apply to the self-conjugate case since $m/N=1/2$ is not small any more. Nevertheless, our study shows a tendency that larger $m$ causes more quantum fluctuations and drives the system more away from the saddle point of $N=\infty$.
(2) As seen from the symmetry, $m$ and $(N-m)$ should give the same exponents. But, the $1/N$ perturbation violates such a symmetry. Although the summation of all diagrams should in principle recover such a symmetry, we don't know how to do it in finite order perturbations right now. \cite{hikami1980}
(3) In order to go beyond the first order perturbation, one need calculate more diagrams. For example, in the vacuum polarization diagrams, the bare $Z$-lines should be replaced by dressed ones and give corrections of order $o(m/N)$ (corresponding to the first order). Then the self energy is corrected to $o(m^2/N^2)$. Repeating the above steps (a self-consistent procedure) would generate all orders of $(m/N)^{1,2,3\cdots}$. Besides the above diagrams, one can further consider the vertex correction terms, which yield other terms such as $o(1/N^2)$, $o(m/N^2)$ and so on.
(4) The $U(N)/U(m)U(N-m)$ model may not be sufficient to
describe the AF phase transition if the paramagnetic phase is a VBS in which case a deconfined theory with an additional
topological term may be necessary to get the correct critical exponents. \cite{senthil2004,motrunich2004} 
Furthermore, for a deconfined critical point, there may be two
length scales and thus two $\nu$s \cite{Shao2016} which are beyond the scope of the Ginzburg-Landau phase transition theory.
